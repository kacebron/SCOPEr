\value{
\strong{MAIN}

\strong{verify} Default value is TRUE which means the run will
compare output to the verification dataset to test the integrity of
your SCOPE copy. FALSE will switch off the verification mode.
Note: You would need to switch off the verification mode if you
want to do actual simulations.

\strong{simulation} Default value is 0 which is equal to
individual runs. Other options can be 1 (time series runs) or 2
(for look-up table).

\strong{OTHERS}

\strong{lite} By default, the value is TRUE which means it will
execute Lite SCOPE with \link{nlayers x 1} sunlit leaves, sunlit leaf
inclinations are not accounted for. FALSE will run in normal SCOPE
execution with \link{13 x 36 x nlayers} sunlit leaves. This is equivalent
to changing to 0 in the setoptions.csv file.

\strong{calc_fluor} By default, the value is TRUE which means
RTMf() is launched in SCOPE.m and calc_brdf() (if calc_directional).
Total emitted fluorescence is calculated by SCOPE.m. If value is
FALSE, no fluorescence output.

\strong{calc_planck} By default, the value is TRUE which means
RTMt_planck() is launched in SCOPE.m and calc_brdf() (if calc_directional).
Calculation is done per each wavelength thus takes more time than
Stefan-Boltzman. If value is FALSE, RTMt_sb() - broadband brightness
temperature is calculated in accordance to Stefan-Boltzmanâ€™s equation.

\strong{calc_xanthophyllabs} By default, the value is TRUE which
means RTMz() is launched in SCOPE.m and calc_brdf() (if calc_directional).
If FALSE, value is changed to 0.

\strong{soilspectrum} By default, the value is FALSE which means it
uses soil spectrum from the file with soil.spectrum default file is
soilnew.txt, can be changed on the filenames sheet soil_file cell
variable name is rsfile. If value is TRUE, it will simulate soil
spectrum with the BSM model (BSM()). Parameters are fixed in code.

\strong{fluorescence_model} By default, the value is FALSE which
means it will run empirical, with sigmoid for Kn: biochemical()
(Berry-Van der Tol). If value is TRUE, it will use biochemical_MD12()
(von Caemmerer-Magnani).

\strong{applTcorr} By default the value is TRUE which means it
will do correction in accordance to Q10 rule. If FALSE, it will
change the value to 0 (no description in SCOPE's github).

\strong{saveCSV} By default, the value is TRUE which means it
will convert .bin files to .csv with bin_to_csv(), delete .bin files.
If value is FALSE, it will leave .bin files in output folder.

\strong{mSCOPE} By default, the value is FALSE which means it will
do a traditional single layer SCOPE. If changed to TRUE, it will run
a multilayer mSCOPE
(see details here: https://scope-model.readthedocs.io/en/master/mSCOPE.html#mscope). # nolint

\strong{calc_directional} Default value is FALSE. If TRUE, struct
directional is loaded from the file directional. calc_brdf() is launched
in SCOPE.m.

\strong{calc_vert_profiles} Default value is FALSE which means profiles
are not calculated. If TRUE, Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) per
layer is calculated in RTMo(). Energy, temperature and photosynthesis fluxes
per layer are calculated in ebal(). Fluorescence fluxes are calculated in
RTMf() if (calc_fluor).

\strong{soil_heat_method} Default value is 2 which means as constant
fraction (0.35) of soil net radiation. Change to 0 and it will do standard
calculation of thermal inertia from soil characteristic. 1 means empirically
calibrated formula from soil moisture content. Soil_Inertia1() in
select_input().

\strong{calc_rss_rbs} Default value is FALSE which means it will use
resistance rss and rbs as provided in inputdata soil. If value is TRUE,
it will calculate rss from soil moisture content and correct rbs for
LAI calc_rssrbs().

\strong{MoninObukhov} Default value is TRUE which means it will apply
Monin-Obukhov atmospheric stability correction. If FALSE, it will not
apply Monin-Obukhov atmospheric stability correction.

\strong{save_spectral} Default value is TRUE which will save,
FALSE it will not save.

\description{
This function helps you modify setoptions.csv. It reads in a CSV
file of options for SCOPE, modifies the values of those options
based on the input parameters, and writes the updated options back
to the CSV file. The function takes several parameters with default
values, primarily \code{verify} and \code{simulation}, which control aspects
of the SCOPE simulation. This function is intended to make it easy
to customize the SCOPE simulation options without modifying the
underlying MATLAB code directly.
